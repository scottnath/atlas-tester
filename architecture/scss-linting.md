## Task Requirements
* basic syntax checking
* test for patterns
* test for inefficiencies

## Choice: [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) + [gulp-scss-lint](https://github.com/juanfran/gulp-scss-lint)

Unfortunately our choices are not wide on this. Also, this requires installing a Ruby gem for scss-lint. Hoping we can improve on this in the future.
